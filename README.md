This repository hosts my [VPM](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/)-Compatible packages for use with the [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/).

## Manual usage

Each package has its own repository, and usually contains a standalone package distribution, as well as a VPM-compatible package distribution. If you want to use the standalone package, you can download it from the releases page of the package's repository.
